Hi there! Currently, I am working on my masters' thesis in Computer Science.  
If everything ends up good, you can follow the development of a novel Network Intrusion Detection System here.  
The target is an anomaly-based NIDS that leverages unsupervised deep learning (probably LSTM-Nets) to find disruptions in Netflows.  

This blog doubles as kind of memo / definition dump and code snippet collection.  
Maybe you find something here that you like? If so, don't hesitate to contact me!
