Fresh from the electronics workbench comes this absolute marvel of custom mechanical keyboards.  
This is the build log and documentation for my problem solving and customizations.

The build (that I'm also using to type this post right now) had some problems and specials that I found not well enough documented.  
This is why I'm adding to the pool of build logs in the hopes that it might provide a shortcut or two for future readers & builders.  
Let me start with a list of things where this build differs from "standard" Dactyls:
- Trackball
- Trackball with scroll mode in QMK
- Mix of Pro Micro (Mini-USB) and Elite-C (USB-C) controllers with IC2
- Sourcing parts in Europe
Especially the last part turned out to be a bit more involved than anticipated for some parts.
